# Tensorboard-shortcuts

This repository was created to save my bookmarklets for tensorboard.

* <b>Update</b> will update all graphs on the screen
* <b>Nightmode</b> will invert all colors and maintain the navbar orange (personal preference)
* <b>Remove Search</b> will remove the search function as well as shape all current graphs horizontally

You can transform all javascript into bookmarklets [here](https://mrcoles.com/bookmarklet/).
